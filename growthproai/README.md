GrowthProAI - Full Stack Intern Assignment
This project is a Mini Local Business Dashboard built using React + Tailwind CSS for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend.
Users can input a business name and location to view a simulated Google rating, number of reviews, and an AI-generated SEO headline.
Implemented two REST API endpoints:

POST /business-data to receive business details and return mock data.

GET /regenerate-headline to return a new random SEO headline.
No database is used â€” all data is simulated in backend code.
Frontend handles state using useState, with loading spinners and basic form validation for better UX.
The UI is fully responsive and mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS.
